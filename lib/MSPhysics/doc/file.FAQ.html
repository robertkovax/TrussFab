<h2 id="label-What+is+the+aim+of+MSPhysics-3F">What is the aim of MSPhysics?</h2>

<p>The major aim of MSPhysics is to improve gaming in SketchUp. One thing that
SketchyPhysics lacks is having control over all mouse and keyboard
operations. Microsoft Windows API has a feature called Hook Procedure. Hook
Procedure allows monitoring and making decisions to the messages reaching a
window procedure. This advantage allows processing of all mouse and
keyboard messages, without SketchUp shortcuts interfering. For example, a
mouse wheel that is, by default, a shortcut for a zoom in/out command could
be instead used as a controller to switch weapons in an FPS game. All mouse
clicks and keyboard buttons could be processed without having to create a
focus redirecting control panel. All in all, this feature allows MSPhysics
to be independent from shortcut commands, which is very suitable for
developers who seek to create FPS games with more control over user input.</p>

<h2 id="label-Is+MSPhysics+a+new+version+of+SketchyPhysics-3F">Is MSPhysics a new version of SketchyPhysics?</h2>

<p>MSPhysics is not the new version of SketchyPhysics. MSPhysics is written
completely from scratch, integrating the latest NewtonDynamics Physics SDK.
Yes, it does have a similar functionality to SketchyPhysics, but that was
done so that SketchyPhysics users wouldn&#39;t have hard time transitioning
to MSPhysics.</p>

<h2 id="label-How+is+MSPhysics+different+from+SketchyPhysics-3F">How is MSPhysics different from SketchyPhysics?</h2>

<p>MSPhysics implements the latest NewtonDynamics physics SDK, making it
faster than SketchyPhysics by a significant factor.</p>

<p>MSPhysics has a very powerful scripting API and a well documented scripting
documentation.</p>

<p>MSPhysics has more and better joints than SketchyPhysics.</p>

<h2 id="label-Does+MSPhysics+work+on+Mac+OS+X-3F">Does MSPhysics work on Mac OS X?</h2>

<p>MSPhysics is compatible with Mac OS X 10.6 or later. Some of the features,
such as receiving keyboard and mouse events, are limited, but most of the
other general features are up and running just fine.</p>

<h2 id="label-How+MSPhysics+Works-3F">How MSPhysics Works?</h2>

<p>MSPhysics uses NewtonDynamics physics engine made by Julio Jerez.
NewtonDynamics is responsible for calculating all the collisions and
physics operations. NewtonDynamics is known for its accuracy and stability.</p>

<h2 id="label-Is+MSPhysics+compatible+with+SketchyPhysics-3F">Is MSPhysics compatible with SketchyPhysics?</h2>

<p>MSPhysics is not compatible with SketchyPhysics. Both plugins may be
installed alongside, but each will act as a separate tool; all attributes
differ. To have a particular model working on both, MSPhysics and
SketchyPhysics, assign similar scripts and properties to the model, through
MSPhysics and SketchyPhysics UIs. Note that SketchyPhysics may lack the
features of MSPhysics and vise versa.</p>
